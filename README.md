# Headless WordPress Using Astro

A static website created with [Astro](https://astro.build/), the web framework for content-driven websites. Content is retreived from a remote WordPress installation. This gives us a widely used CMS in the background without compromising on performance, as all pages are pre-rendered at build time and load super-fast.
